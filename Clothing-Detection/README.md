# Clothing detection using YOLOv3 in ModaNet and DeepFashion2 datasets.

- YOLOv3 trained with Darknet framework (Darknet53)
- Darknet-53 is a convolutional neural network that acts as a backbone for the YOLOv3 object detection approach.
- Datasets: DeepFashion2 and ModaNet
- All weights and config files are downloaded
- yolo/weights/yolov3-df2_15000.weights && yolo/df2cfg/df2.names
- yolov3-df2.cfg - Network config file (so that we can reply the network)
